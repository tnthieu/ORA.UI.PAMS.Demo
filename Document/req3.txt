12)Validation during edit mode.  If there is an error, how can we communicate the error to the grid.
- I see there is client validation from devextreme. But I think you mean here the validation on server side and commnunicate this error to the grid. Please confirm. 

14)In Edit mode, can we add tool tips
Can you give an example to be sure I understand this one correctly?
Maybe user clicks Edit, then mouse over an editable text, and we will show a tooltip?

15)In Edit mode, can we add images, links
For the links, can you explain more? 

16)Option to select rows on the grid and extract data associated to the grid.
Can you explain more for this?
Now in the demo, user can press Ctrl and select multiple rows. What do you mean for "extract data associated to the grid"? Can you give me an example?
