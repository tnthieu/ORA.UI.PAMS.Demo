12)Validation during edit mode.  If there is an error, how can we communicate the error to the grid.

MR => I’d like the business rules to be validated on the server via a web api call.

For example, when the user clicks on Save, can Save pass the contents of the row to the Web API call and can the grid display the error message returned by the Web Api call ?

16)Option to select rows on the grid and extract data associated to the grid.

MR => I’m glad user can press Ctrl and select multiple rows.  Can this option (check box) to select multiple rows always show up ?

Does the user have to press Ctrl ?  and if the check boxes always show up, can we hide it or unhide it ?

As far as "extract data associated to the grid", on the Advanced Deliverables grid, we were able to disable some rows based on the status of the deliverable.  Is this possible with dev extreme ?
